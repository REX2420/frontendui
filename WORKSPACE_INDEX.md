## 📊 Index Best Practices

### 1. Barrel Exports Pattern
```typescript
// components/ui/index.ts
export { Button } from './button'
export { Card } from './card'
export { Dialog } from './dialog'
// ... all other UI components
```

### 2. Type Definitions
```typescript
// types/index.ts
export type { User, Product, Order } from './models'
export type { ApiResponse, ErrorResponse } from './api'
export type { ComponentProps } from './components'
```

### 3. Feature-Based Grouping
```typescript
// features/shop/index.ts
export { ShopPage } from './ShopPage'
export { ProductCard } from './ProductCard'
export { CategoryFilter } from './CategoryFilter'
```

## 🛠️ How to Use This Workspace

### Opening the Workspace
1. Open Cursor
2. File → Open Workspace from File
3. Select `vibecart-ecosystem.code-workspace`

### Running Services
- **Single Service**: Use individual tasks (🛒, 🔧, 🏪)
- **All Services**: Run "🚀 Start All Services" task
- **Terminal**: Each service runs in separate terminal panels

### Navigation Tips
- Use Cmd/Ctrl + P to search files across all projects
- Project names in search results show which app the file belongs to
- Use workspace-relative paths for cross-project references

## 🔍 Search & Indexing Optimization

### File Exclusions
- `node_modules/` directories
- `.next/` build outputs  
- `.git/` version control
- `package-lock.json` files

### TypeScript Features
- Auto-imports across all projects
- IntelliSense for shared types
- Cross-project navigation
- Unified error reporting

## 📈 Recommended Next Steps

1. **Create Missing Index Files**: Add barrel exports for better organization
2. **Shared Dependencies**: Consider moving common utilities to a shared package
3. **Monorepo Structure**: Evaluate moving to a monorepo with tools like Turborepo
4. **Testing Setup**: Configure Jest/Vitest for all projects
5. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up GitHub Actions for all three projects

## 🔄 Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Update workspace configuration as projects evolve
- Keep index files synchronized with new components
- Review and update shared dependencies
- Maintain consistent coding standards across projects

### Monitoring
- Track build times across projects
- Monitor bundle sizes
- Review TypeScript errors across workspace
- Ensure consistent code quality
